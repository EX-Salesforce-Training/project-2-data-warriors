# Project 2: Student Prep Shop - A Client Facing Experience Site

This is a teambased project revolving around an ecommerce business model. We created a business called Student Prep Shop, an online company that sells school supplies to various schools. The client interacts with the business by engaging in the client-facing experience site, where they may view, purchase, and collaborate on all available products.

This project leverages Apex and Experience Cloud to provide a client-facing site that integrates with the Salesforce org. Project requirements include the following:
 - Lighting Web Components
 - Aura Components that interact with LWC
 - implementation of LMS
 - Apex classes to supplement components
 - Various Apex triggers
 - Additional declarative customizations to replicate business model

The team developed the project using the Package Development Model that included 3 packages total. Of these packages we had a base package with two additional dependant packages.
